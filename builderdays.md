# Builder Days

Builder Days is our version of a laid back co working and a hackathon. Its purpose is to educate and onboard developers to different open source/ FOSS Bitcoin projects. Participating bitcoin FOSS projects will run programming at their own tables. As a participant, you get to pick your favorite project to hang out with and learn from.
